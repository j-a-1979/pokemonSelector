Pokémon Selection Console Game (C# .NET)

This is a simple, beginner-friendly console application built in C# (.NET) where the player can choose their first Pokémon. The program introduces three starter Pokémon (Pikachu, Charmander, and Bulbasaur), each with their own name, level, and type.

The user can select a Pokémon either by typing its number or its name, and the program responds with a confirmation message, a short description, and a small ASCII art version of the chosen Pokémon.
