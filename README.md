This is a simple console-based application built in C# (.NET) where the player can choose their first Pokémon. The program introduces three starter Pokémon: Pikachu, Charmander, and Bulbasaur. Each Pokémon has its own name, level, and type, defined through a custom class.

The user can select a Pokémon by typing either its number or its name. The program then responds with a confirmation message, a brief description, and a small ASCII art representation of the chosen Pokémon.

Features

• Basic class structure using custom Pokémon objects
• User input handling with case-insensitive comparisons
• Loop-based menu for repeated input
• ASCII art display for each Pokémon
• Beginner-friendly code organization
• Demonstrates OOP concepts such as classes, objects, and properties

Technologies

• C#
• .NET Console Application

Purpose

This project was created as a practice exercise for learning:

• Object-oriented programming (OOP)
• Organizing classes and objects in separate files
• Working with user input and console output
• Implementing simple game logic in a console environment
